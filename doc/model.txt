The model describes the motion of a ball in a plinko board.

In the intro tab this probability is 50% so that the ball has equal
chance to go right than it does to go left. The model is made up of the pegs and
balls. The ball makes a random decision to go left of right. It does this of how ever
many rows are present. The user can choose to send 1, 10 or all the balls and watch
how the balls fall into the different containers at the bottom

In the lab model both the number of rows and the probability is changeable.
The user can move a slider that changes the probability and the number of rows.
At this moment all of the balls disappear and new balls are dropped that have
the information of the new Galton Board.

The statistics are update after a ball makes it to the bottom.

Equation used
Mean = (N-1 * currentMean + binNumber)/N Where N is the number of balls
For example:
if the first ball drops into bin 4 and the second into bin 6 the equation will be
(1-1 * 0 + 4)/1 = 4 after the first ball
(2-1 * 4 + 6)/2 = 5 after the second ball

Everytime a ball is added the square is added to the bins
Sum of squares += (binNumber * binNumber)

Variance = (sum of squares - N * mean^2)/( N -1)

Standard Deviation = Sqrt( Variance )

Standard Deviation of the Mean = standard Deviation / sqrt( N )
