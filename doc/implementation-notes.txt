Implementation notes for plinko-probability

This simulation has two different parts the lab and intro model

The Galton Board is created with all of the possible pegs.
Each of the pegs is given a row and a column and the spacing between
the peg separation is determined by the number of rows that we want to see.

There is a Ball object with the knowledge of where the it should move.
When an instance of this is created we use the provided probability to get
the path. Depending of the probability the ball has some chance of going left of right.
Using random numbers the ball stores the path that it will take and saves it for later use.
The ball 'knows' from the moment it is created which bin it is going to land.

The the ball model is displayed using an image which is then scaled to fit as it should.

The ball motion is divided into four phases PHASE_INITIAL, PHASE_FALLING, PHASE_EXIT, and PHASE_COLLECTED.
As the step function gets called the ball goes through each of the four phases updating it's position based
on the path that it 'chose' at it's creation. Finally, it ends up at the histogram and it is added to the
statistics of the histogram.

The histogram hols all of the statistics of the model
it holds an array, each element is the number of balls in a bin.
Each time a ball exits the Galton Board one of the bins is incremented by one.
These numbers are then used to calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation.

the view model takes the position of the model ball, transforms it and makes the view happen.
